# WAA Soundboard App

**SoundBoard** - *(v1.0)* 

	This is the simplest HTML5 media demo I could imagine.  A nice starting point to introduce a new user to
	WebWorks, HTML5, and cross-platform development.  This is a write once, run anywhere app that should scale
	nicely across BB6+ devices, Playbook Tablets, Android Smartphones and Tabets, iOS devices, and even 
	Desktop Widgets / HTML5 compliant browsers!  It also takes advantage of off-line communication - you don't
	need any internet access to run this app with full functionality!

**Requirements:**

1. A WebKit-based browser, even better with a Blackberry, that can handle the HTML5 media/audio element.

## How to use

Simply compile it in either webworks sdk (tablet or smartphone - or both!).  It will spit out a .jad/.cod/.bar file depending on your target.  Deploy the file and enjoy!


Originally all of the code was intentionally in the index.html file to make this simple to understand and distribute as an example.  However, it has been updated to use object literal notation and split out into different files.  An "evolutionary" staging build (broken out into 5 stages), is available from the author if you would like to use this as an example of how code could be written initially, and eventually become something cleaner.
